# C2PA Public test files

This repository contains a collection of test files organized by format and date that provide examples of C2PA implementations.

NOTE: This page is best viewed as [rendered by GitHub pages](https://spec.c2pa.org/public-testfiles//), not directly in GitHub.

## Naming convention

For clarity, all files are named with the pattern: `[supplier]-[YYYYMMDD]-[optional_descriptive_string].[extension]`.

For example: `adobe-20220101-man_walking.jpg`.

## Backwards compatibility

All files maintained here should work with any implementation created after the file date.

## Inspecting files

README files rendered using GitHub pages provide a convenient way to inspect the asset files using the [Verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) online tool, with corresponding manifest reports created with [C2PA Tool](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/):
