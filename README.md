# C2PA Public test files

This repository contains a collection of test files with which to test C2PA implementations.

This repository is organized by format and date. 

## Naming convention 

For clarity, all files are named with the pattern: `[supplier]-[YYYYMMDD]-[optional_descriptive_string].[extension]`.

For example: `adobe-20220101-man_walking.jpg`.

## Backwards compatibility 

All files maintained here should work with any implementation created after the file date.

## Inspecting files

README files rendered using GitHub pages provide a convenient way to inspect the asset files using the [Verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) online tool, with corresponding manifest reports created with [C2PA Tool](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/):
