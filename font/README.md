# Font test files

NOTE: This page is meant to be viewed as [rendered by GitHub pages](https://spec.c2pa.org/public-testfiles/image/), not in GitHub.

Files are named with the pattern: `[supplier]-[YYYYMMDD]-[optional_descriptive_string].[extension]`.

## TrueType files

The manifest store JSON files listed below are generated by running [C2PA Tool](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/).

> NOTE: The `c2patool` `main` branch does not currently support font assets, thus the public verify endpoint will not currently verify the assets.  Manifests have been generated using a version of `c2patool` which does support fonts.
